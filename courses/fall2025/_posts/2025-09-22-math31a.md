### Discussion notes:
This course covers **differential and integral calculus**.

<!-- **Week 0:** Precalculus review.

**Week 1:** No notes. Lecture contentLimits, limit laws, continuity, types of discontinuities, evaluating limits and indeterminate forms.

**Week 2:** Trig limits and squeeze theorem, limits at infinity, Intermediate Value Theorem, the derivative.

**Week 3:** The derivative as a function, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule.

**Week 4:** Higher derivatives, trig derivatives, implicit differentiation, related rates. -->
