    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I am a Ph.D. student at UCLA studying applied mathematics. 
        My academic interests generally include differential equations and numerical analysis
        with applications to science and engineering.
        I am also very passionate about teaching and tutoring students in science and math (see the <a href="/teaching.html">Teaching page</a> to learn more).
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of the classroom, you can usually find me playing basketball and tennis, reading, or occasionally on the video game.
