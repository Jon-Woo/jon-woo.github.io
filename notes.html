    <p>
        Mostly for my own reference but also for others, I have uploaded a collection of
        my notes compiled from textbooks, lectures, and online courses.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many of my notes contain solutions to exercises from various sources. If you are a student, please do not just
        copy my solutions; it will do you no good to cheat yourself of proper learning. 
        If you are an instructor and would like me to remove my notes for these reasons, please contact me.
